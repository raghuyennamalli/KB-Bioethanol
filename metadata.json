To precisely determine the preferred codon usage of T. fuciformis we sequenced the genome of strain Tr26 resulting in a 24.5 Mb draft genome with 10,040 predicted genes. 3288 of the derived predicted proteins matched the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databases with 40% or more similarity. Corresponding gene models of this subset were subsequently optimized trough repetitive comparison of alternative start codons and selection of best length matching gene models. For experimental confirmation of gene models, 96 random clones from an existing T. fuciformis cDNA library were sequenced, generating 80 complete CDSs. Calculated optimal codons (RSCU and RFCU values) for the 3288 predicted and the 80 cloned CDSs were highly similar, indicating sufficient accuracy of predicted gene models for codon usage analysis. T. fuciformis showed a strong preference for C and then G (C+G; 66.4 %) at the third base pair position of used codons, while average GC content of predicted genes was slightly higher (58.5 %) than he total genome sequence average (55.9%). Most frequently used codons (optimal codons) all ended in C or G except for one (Ter; AGU), and an increased frequency of C ending codons was observed in genes with higher expression levels. Surprisingly, the preferred codon usage in T. fuciformis strongly differed from T. mesenterica (same genus) and C. neoformans (same family). Instead, optimal codon usage was similar to more distant related species such as Ustilago maydis and Neurospora crassa. Despite much higher overall sequence homology between T. fuciformis and T. mesenterica only 7 out of 21 optimal codons were equal, whereas T. fuciformis shared up to 20 out 21 optimal codons with other species. Clearly, codon usage in Tremella can differ largely and should be estimated for individual species.

Here, we conducted a systematic identification and characterization of the glucose dual-affinity transport system in the model fungus Neurospora crassa.

The high-affinity transporters hgt-1/-2 were able to complement a moderate growth defect under high glucose when glt-1 was deleted. Simultaneous deletion of hgt-1/-2 led to extensive derepression of genes for plant cell wall deconstruction on cellulose. This suppression by HGT-1/-2 was connected to both carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A pathway. Alteration of a residue conserved across taxa for hexose-transporters was found to result in a loss of glucose-transporting function, whereas CCR signal transduction was retained, indicating a dual function for HGT-1/-2 as \u201ctransceptors\u201d. In this study, GLT-1 and HGT-1/-2 are identified as the key components of the glucose dual-affinity transport system, which play diverse roles in glucose transport and carbon metabolism.

Functionally unclassified proteins were counted for most up-regulated genes, while genes were enriched with different functions for different down-regulation patterns. We observed significant increase in transcription for mat a-1 and for mat A-1 specific pheromone precursor ccg-4 during the perithecial development, and expression of genetic markers for morphological traits in perithecium, ascus, and ascospore, and for development traits in meiosis often showed multiple peaks during the experiment.

Here, we conducted a systematic identification and characterization of the glucose dual-affinity transport system in the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Using RNA sequencing coupled with functional transport analyses, we were able to assign GLT-1 (Km = 18.42 \u00b1 3.38 mM) and HGT-1/-2 (Km = 16.13 \u00b1 0.95 \u00b5M and 98.97 \u00b1 22.02 \u00b5M) to low- and high-affinity glucose transport systems, respectively. The high-affinity transporters hgt-1/-2 were able to complement a moderate growth defect under high glucose when glt-1 was deleted. Simultaneous deletion of hgt-1/-2 led to extensive derepression of genes for plant cell wall deconstruction on cellulose. This suppression by HGT-1/-2 was connected to both carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A pathway. Alteration of a residue conserved across taxa for hexose-transporters was found to result in a loss of glucose-transporting function, whereas CCR signal transduction was retained, indicating a dual function for HGT-1/-2 as \u201ctransceptors\u201d. In this study, GLT-1 and HGT-1/-2 are identified as the key components of the glucose dual-affinity transport system, which play diverse roles in glucose transport and carbon metabolism.

RNA sequencing with different priming strategies have been efficient to provide fine-scale transcriptome landscapes for a multiple-staged development process. RNA were sampled for eight time points cross perithecial development, including two points right before and after crossing, for which mat A protoperithecia were fertilized with mat a conidia. Transcription profiles for 9717 genes were achieved for all eight time-points using multi-targeting priming and additional 14 genes for five time-points using random hexmas priming. Majority of the genome showed continually up- or down- regulated expression patterns during the later perithecial development stages after 72 or 96 h. Functionally unclassified proteins were counted for most up-regulated genes, while genes were enriched with different functions for different down-regulation patterns. We observed significant increase in transcription for mat a-1 and for mat A-1 specific pheromone precursor ccg-4 during the perithecial development, and expression of genetic markers for morphological traits in perithecium, ascus, and ascospore, and for development traits in meiosis often showed multiple peaks during the experiment.

This study provided further evidence for functional correlation among genes involved in same function or pathways, which included mating type genes and pheromones, transcription factors, pigmentation, heterokaryotic incompatibility, singaling pathways, and RNA silencing.

The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates, from simple sugars to the complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls. The zinc binuclear cluster transcription factor CLR-1 is necessary for utilization of cellulose, a major, recalcitrant component of the plant cell wall; however, expression of clr-1 in the absence of an inducer is not sufficient to induce cellulase gene expression. We performed a screen for unidentified actors in the cellulose-response pathway and identified a gene encoding a hypothetical protein (clr-3) that is required for repression of CLR-1 activity in the absence of an inducer. Using clr-3 mutants, we implicated the hyperosmotic-response pathway in the tunable regulation of glycosyl hydrolase production in response to changes in osmolarity. The role of the hyperosmotic-response pathway in nutrient sensing may indicate that cells use osmolarity as a proxy for the presence of free sugar in their environment.

To expand this knowledge base, we have reconstructed a detailed network of those reactions occurring in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa that are important for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides into simple sugars. To build this network, we integrated information from five heterogeneous data types: functional genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, genetics, and biochemical characterizations. We encapsulated the combined information into a feature matrix and weighed evidence to assign annotation confidence scores for each gene within the network. Comparative analyses of next-generation transcriptome sequencing profiles for N. crassa grown on different substrates corresponding to specific plant cell wall polysaccharides revealed environment-specific modules within the network. Subsequent analyses of next-generation ChIP and RNA sequencing data within the network context shed new light on how N. crassa regulates the plant cell wall degradation network (PCWDN). Specifically, our system-level analyses led to the hypothesis-driven experimental validation of the role transcription factor CLR-2 plays in degradation of the major hemicellulose mannan.

Fungal pectinases already play a crucial role for industrial purposes, such as for foodstuff processing. However, the regulation of pectinase gene expression is still poorly understood. For an optimal utilization of plant biomass for biorefinery and biofuel production, a detailed analysis of the underlying regulatory mechanisms is warranted. In this study, we applied the genetic resources of the filamentous ascomycete species Neurospora crassa to screen for transcription factors that play a major role in pectinase induction. Results: The pectin degradation regulator-1 (PDR-1) was identified through a transcription factor mutant screen in N. crassa. The \u0394pdr-1 mutant exhibited a severe growth defect on pectin and all tested pectin-related poly- and monosaccharides. Biochemical as well as transcriptional analyses of WT and the \u0394pdr-1 mutant revealed that while PDR-1-mediated gene induction was dependent on the presence of L-rhamnose, it also strongly affected the degradation of the homogalacturonan backbone. The expression of the endo-polygalacturonase gh28-1 was greatly reduced in the \u0394pdr-1 mutant, while the expression levels of all pectate lyase genes increased. Moreover, a pdr-1 overexpression strain displayed substantially increased pectinase production. Promoter analysis of the PDR-1 regulon allowed refinement of the putative PDR-1 DNA binding motif. Conclusions: PDR-1 is highly conserved in filamentous ascomycete fungi and is present in many pathogenic and industrially important fungi. Our data demonstrate that the function of PDR-1 in N. crassa combines features of two recently described transcription factors in Aspergillus niger (RhaR) and Botrytis cinerea (GaaR).

The glucose sensing and uptaking process were believed to be tightly involved in cellulases expression regulation in cellulolytic fungi.

Here, we conducted a systematic identification and characterization of the glucose dual-affinity transport system in the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Using RNA sequencing coupled with functional transport analyses, we were able to assign GLT-1 (Km = 18.42 \u00b1 3.38 mM) and HGT-1/-2 (Km = 16.13 \u00b1 0.95 \u00b5M and 98.97 \u00b1 22.02 \u00b5M) to low- and high-affinity glucose transport systems, respectively. The high-affinity transporters hgt-1/-2 were able to complement a moderate growth defect under high glucose when glt-1 was deleted. Simultaneous deletion of hgt-1/-2 led to extensive derepression of genes for plant cell wall deconstruction on cellulose. This suppression by HGT-1/-2 was connected to both carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A pathway. Alteration of a residue conserved across taxa for hexose-transporters was found to result in a loss of glucose-transporting function, whereas CCR signal transduction was retained, indicating a dual function for HGT-1/-2 as \u201ctransceptors\u201d. In this study, GLT-1 and HGT-1/-2 are identified as the key components of the glucose dual-affinity transport system, which play diverse roles in glucose transport and carbon metabolism.

Treated with MP, we found a differential expression of genes annotated to cell wall structure, and to cell cycle programme compared to untreated control, which could explain the changes in morphology. The up-regulation of genes encoding for toxins, iron acquisition, and cell wall components enforcing oxidative stress resistance would theoretically result in a more pathogenic A. fumigatus phenotype.

The annotation of the reference genome of Chaetomium thermophilum has been reported previously, but it is limited to open reading frames (ORFs) of genes and contains only a few noncoding transcripts. In this study, we identified and annotated by deep RNA sequencing full-length transcripts of C.thermophilum. We identified 7044 coding genes and a large number of noncoding genes (n=4567). Astonishingly, 23% of the coding genes are alternatively spliced. We identified 679 novel coding genes and corrected the structural organization of more than 50% of the previously annotated genes. Furthermore, we substantially extended the Gene Ontology (GO) and Enzyme Commission (EC) lists, which provide comprehensive search tools for potential industrial applications and basic research. The identified novel transcripts and improved annotation will help understanding the gene regulatory landscape in C.thermophilum. The analysis pipeline developed here can be used to build transcriptome assemblies and identify coding and noncoding RNAs of other species. The new genome annotation of the GTF file can be found here."}]
